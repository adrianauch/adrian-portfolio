# adrian-portfolio

##Description
Web application was created to show inform users about me, showcase future projects and my contact information. The project main motivation was to have a single location to hold all my work and a brief description about me for future employeers. Rather than have serval different link on my linkedin for employeers to view. Addtionally, the web application can give potentional employeers a better sense of my personality through my design and what I have included for my description. This project was my first application where I wasn't given any code, where I could build and stylize an application with minimal guidelines. Creating the HTML followed a basic format of most portolifios. However, I was able to be creative to in the way I wanted to present my information to the user and create small animation just in css. Using media quaries to make my application usable indifferent viewports was the most challenge part of the project for me. I think that the portfolio currently has a good base, where I can showcase future projects and add more individualism as I grow as a developer.

##Usage
Only need a Web broswer and internet to access my application. I have added a screeenshot below for a glipse of the web application.
